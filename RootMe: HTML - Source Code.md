# RootMe: HTML - Source Code

## Notes

Starting the challenge brings us to a login screen in firefox

## Viewing Page Source

Right-clicking the Firefox page provides a menu, including an option to "View Page Source"

Opening Page Source opens the source code for the web page. Looking at the bottom of the screen shows a horizontal scroll bar. Scrolling all the way to the right showed a section of text "hidden" from the regular view. Within this block of text was the password to capture the flag.
